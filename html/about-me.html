      Hi there! As you already know, my name is Yailan Bordas. <br />
      I was born in Havana, Cuba where I soon moved to the United States. Here
      is where I found the world of technology and all it has to offer.

        <h3>PAST</h3>
        <p>
          Growing up I learned about coding during my middle school years. Soon,
          I started learning HTML and CSS in High School, focusing my time more
          towards learning code. I fell in love with Web Development and all the
          possibilities it came with. I was always facinated with the creativity
          of coding.

        <h3>PRESENT</h3>
        <p>
          I am currently a Computer Science student at Florida International
          University graduating in 2026. Over the course of my studies, I have
          gained hands on experience in front-end development, using
          technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Java and
          various others.

        <h3>FUTURE</h3>
        <p>
          I am eager to continuously learn and grow as a developer, and I
          actively keep up with newest web technologies and trends. With strong
          communication skills and a collaborative mindset, I am excited to
          contribute to important and meaningful projects and expand my
          experience in the tech field.
